# `@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types`

**TypeScript definitions for NubeSDK**, ensuring safety, consistency, and better integration with IDEs and code editors.


`@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types` provides **well-defined TypeScript types** for **NubeSDK**, simplifying the development of **third-party apps** within the **Nuvemshop** platform.

Apps in NubeSDK run **inside isolated web workers**, without direct access to the DOM. This package standardizes **data structures, events, and interfaces**, ensuring **type safety and consistency** in communication with the platform.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @tiendanube/nube-sdk-types
```

## Main Types

This package provides essential type definitions for NubeSDK integration, including:

### Application State

`NubeSDKState` â†’ Represents the SDK's global state (cart, store, UI, etc.).

### Events

- `NubeSDKSendableEvent` â†’ Events that can be sent to the SDK.
- `NubeSDKListenableEvent`  â†’ Events that apps can listen to.
- `NubeSDKListener` â†’ Function signature for event handlers.

### Data Models

- `Cart` â†’ Represents the shopping cart structure.
- `Store` â†’ Information about the store where the apps is running.
- `AppLocation` â†’ Represents the user's current page within the platform.

### UI Components
- `NubeComponent` â†’ Declarative representation of a UI component.
- `NubeComponentBox`, NubeComponentRow, NubeComponentField, etc. 

## Example Usage

```ts
import type { NubeSDK, NubeSDKState } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";

function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
  nube.on("cart:update", (state: NubeSDKState) => {
    console.log("Cart updated:", state.cart);
  });
}
```
