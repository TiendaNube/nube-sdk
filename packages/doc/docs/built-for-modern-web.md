# Built for the Modern Web

NubeSDK is designed for the present and future of web development. With a modern architecture focused on security, performance, and scalability, it provides partners with a solid foundation to build advanced experiences — all while maintaining control and predictability.

## Isolation by design

Each app runs in a fully isolated scope using **Web Workers**, ensuring secure execution without impacting the store or other apps. This model prevents conflicts, strengthens security, and allows multiple apps to run in parallel with no interference.

## UI as data

App interfaces are described using declarative data structures, interpreted by the platform in real time. This allows visual elements to be defined in a safe, standardized way — without direct DOM access. For developers who prefer it, optional JSX support is available for a more ergonomic development experience.

## Web Standards

The SDK includes tools and APIs that follow modern best practices — such as **controlled access to storage**, an **asynchronous event system**, and **dynamic rendering via slots**. These features enable developers to build interactive experiences with less coupling and more control.

## Design consistency

Styling in NubeSDK follows a **declarative model**, with the **CSS-in-JS** approach. Components are natively integrated with the store’s theme, ensuring a visually consistent experience **without any additional work from developers**. When needed, styles can be customized using **reusable style objects** and **theme variables exposed by the platform**, preserving both design consistency and app flexibility.

This approach allows apps built with NubeSDK to be reliable, fast, secure — and fully compatible with the way the modern web is built.
