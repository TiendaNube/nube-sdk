# `@tiendanube/nube-sdk-jsx`

**Library for building JSX-based UI components in NubeSDK.**

## About

`@tiendanube/nube-sdk-jsx` enables developers to use **JSX/TSX syntax** to define UI components declaratively within **NubeSDK**. This package simplifies UI development by allowing a more familiar and ergonomic way to create interfaces while maintaining compatibility with the NubeSDK UI system.

Apps in NubeSDK run **inside isolated web workers**, without direct access to the DOM. This package ensures that JSX components are converted into structured objects, which are then interpreted by the platform for rendering.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @tiendanube/nube-sdk-jsx @tiendanube/nube-sdk-ui @tiendanube/nube-sdk-types
```

> Note: `@tiendanube/nube-sdk-ui` and `@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types` are peer dependencies and must be installed alongside this package.

## Example Usage

```tsx
import type { NubeSDK } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-types";
import { Field } from "@tiendanube/nube-sdk-jsx";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Field
        label="First Name"
        name="firstname"
        onChange={(e) => {
          console.log(`User first name: ${e.value}`);
        }}
      />
      <Field
        label="Last Name"
        name="lastname"
        onChange={(e) => {
          console.log(`User last name: ${e.value}`);
        }}
      />
    <>
  );
}

export function App(nube: NubeSDK) {
  nube.send("ui:slot:set", () => ({
    ui: {
      slots: {
        after_line_items: <MyComponent />,
      },
    },
  }));
}
```
