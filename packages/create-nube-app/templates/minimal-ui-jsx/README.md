# Minimum setup for UI app development with NubeSDK using JSX

This project uses the type package in version `0.1.2-alpha` and `tsup` to compile typescript to javascript

# How to use

- install the development dependencies with the `npm install` command.
- Then start the development changing the `src/main.tsx` file.
- To compile the project use the `npm run build` command.
- The contents of the `src/jsx` is required for JSX support, in the future we will provide a new `npm` package with the JSX support embedded.

The final script is created in the `dist` folder.
